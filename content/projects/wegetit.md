## Overview

WeGetIt is an experimental communication platform that strives for shared understanding above all else.

Rather than providing a means for completely unrestricted conversations, which are prone to devolving into flame wars and pointless hate, WeGetIt structures conversations around understanding one another's meanings. 

## Origins

WeGetIt is a program originally envisioned in Karl Schroeder's short story Degrees of Freedom, in the Hieroglyph anthology. It's intended to form an integral part of a future political system that is more just and fair. It fits in well with the general theme of Hieroglyph as a collection of science fiction stories that inspire people to work on and build a better tomorrow.

We build WeGetIt precisely because we yearn to build a better tomorrow, and were inspired by Schroeder's story. We don't know if WeGetIt can, or will, have the same importance in the real world as it did in his story, but we believe that it's important to explore and experiment with these things. If no one builds the better tomorrow, then we can't expect it to arrive.
